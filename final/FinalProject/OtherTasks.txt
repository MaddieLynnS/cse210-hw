~Added menu functionality: see score on past assignments
~Fix problem with due dates- they currently keep moving farther into the future because they
are set currently using DateTime.Now.AddDays
~Verify that completed assignments don't show up on any printed lists
~Print whether a course has been completed in PrintAssignmentInfo
~Fix Priority jankiness
~Make it so you can manually complete an assignment from the outside??
~Save people in .txt files so they can be loaded for future use
~Error handling for ALL user input -_-
~See about implementing a function that will like accept a string if it's close enough lol
~Maybe in future I create thing that just checks new assignments against existing list for
UpdateAssignmentList??
~Implement further sorting in Priority for if a course grade is lower in one class than in another
~if i really wanted to be extra I could let user enter multiple assignments into AddAssignment
and split them up myself but I'm not there right now
~Count the words in a submission of text mwahaha
