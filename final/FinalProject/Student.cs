    //Prioritize assignments in following order?
    //Closest to farthest due date of course
    //Tests should always go on top
    //Assignments with high priority will be just beneath any tests - i think this could be removed
    //Assignments worth more points should trump low points
    //if due within three days of each other
    //Assignments that take longer to complete should trump
    //assignments with similar points/due dates
    //Assignments from the course with the lower overall grade
    //should trump any short, low-point assignments

    //Example implementing the above logic
    //1- quiz due on 12/8 worth 40 points, takes 15 minutes
    //2- writing due on 12/5 worth 100 points, takes five hours
    //3- submit pic due on 12/6 worth 20 points, takes 5 minutes
    //4- writing due on 12/9 worth 50 points, takes 2 hours
    //5- discussion due on 12/6 worth 40 points, takes 30 minutes
    //6- test due 12/7 worth 100 points, takes an hour
    //7- submit doc due on 12/5 worth 30 points, takes 20 minutes
    //8- discussion due on 12/7 worth 20 points, takes 20 minutes
    //9- test due 12/5 worth 50 points, takes an hour

    //6, 9,
